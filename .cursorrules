# LAF MVP – project rules

## Git / GitHub
- **After making changes that should be saved:** remind the user to commit and push, or run: `git add -A && git commit -m "<message>" && git push origin main` (with an appropriate message and with git_write + network permissions). Do not forget to push to GitHub when the user or the task implies the work should be persisted remotely.
